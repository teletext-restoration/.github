# Welcome to the Teletext recovery archiving and restoration project.

## Who are we?
The teletext restoration team are a group of teletext enthusiasts involved in the recovery and cleanup of teletext data from VHS tape, who pool our resources to collect and share teletext recoveries and the resulting reconstructed pages. Many thanks are owed to the wider teletext recovery community for sharing their recoveries with us.

Current restoration and curation projects include the Digitiser archive on [Super Page 58](https://www.superpage58.com), the [Turner the Worm Archive](https://zxnet.co.uk/teletext/turner-archive/), the [Mega-Zine Museum](https://www.zinemuseum.co.uk), and the [Park Avenue Project](http://www.newmailbox.co.uk/parkavenue/).

This archive grew out of the efforts to archive Digitiser and Turner the Worm, and mostly contains the recoveries supplied to those projects. While the process of cataloguing that large body of recoveries was underway, we have continued to collect new recoveries for those projects (i.e. ITV recordings from early 1993, and Channel 4/S4C recordings from 1993 onwards). As we come to the end of that backlog we, have begun collecting recoveries from the other UK broadcasters and time periods to build out those parts of the archive.

## What is teletext recovery?
Everything in the archive has been extracted from old home video recordings using the [VHS teletext](https://github.com/ali1234/vhs-teletext) tools created by Alistair Buxton. This is able to recover a teletext datastream from off-air recordings, albeit usually with many errors.

## Who is this for?
The primary goal of this project is to collect together and catalogue the teletext recoveries produced by the growing teletext recovery community to make them available to anyone working on restoring and archiving the pages of specific sections of a teletext service (e.g. Digitiser).

It also acts as a resource for anyone researching technical details of teletext broadcasts over the years, such as the introduction of, and changes to, normally hidden aspects of a teletext signal like PDC, databroadcasting, Audetel, and internal test pages.

This project catalogues raw t42 datastreams from the teletext recovery process, and restored pages also in t42 format for further analysis and processing. If you're looking for a browsable archive of teletext pages which can be read online, see the [Teletext Archaeologist Archive](https://archive.teletextarchaeologist.org/).

## Do you want my teletext recoveries?
Yes - but possibly not all at once.

Cataloguing recoveries can be time consuming depending on what is submitted, and we are currently a small team working through backlogs of files. It helps a lot if people are able to do some pre-processing of their submissions - documentation covering this is underway.

The archive currently collects recoveries of UK television channels only. Similar archives for other countries/regions could be created under the same teletext-restoration umbrella if somebody steps up as maintainer/assembles a team to do it.

## I don't have any recovery equipment, can I still help? I really enjoy doing boring repetitive tasks* and want to join your team.
*(I don't imagine anyone is saying this, but just in case...)

There are many tasks that people can work on outside of the recovery process itself, like working on an archive sub-project (i.e. restoring the pages of a particular magazine section), or cataloguing submitted recoveries. Again guides for these roles will be written in due course.

The project team currently coordinate activity through the [teletext discord server](https://discord.gg/JfytfS3xmg). If you make yourself known there, or contact <archive@zxnet.co.uk> we can discuss you joining the team.
